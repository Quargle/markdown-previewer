# Markdow Previewer

This is the repository for a Svelte markdown previewer. The idea is taken from a [FreeCodeCamp challenge](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/front-end-development-libraries-projects/build-a-markdown-previewer) but this is implemented in Svelte, which is not currently supported by FreeCode Camp.

AS a result, this implementation does not pass all of the 8 automated tests assigned for this challenge, even though it appears to meet the test criteria.
